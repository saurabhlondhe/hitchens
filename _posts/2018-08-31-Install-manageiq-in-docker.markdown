Docker image for ManageIQ is available. It can be run in a Docker container. There are also other options like [Public cloud](http://manageiq.org/docs/get-started/cloud) or [Vagrant](http://manageiq.org/docs/get-started/vagrant) to get started with ManageIQ. It can run everywhere Docker is available.

First thing, you have to install Docker on your system. Follow instructions in [Docker docs](https://store.docker.com/search?type=edition&offering=community) to install Docker.

Start Docker service using

```sh
sudo service docker start
```

or do

```sh
systemctl start docker
```

---

### Step 1: Pull Docker image of ManageIQ

```sh
sudo docker pull manageiq/manageiq
```

or

```sh
sudo docker pull manageiq/manageiq:gaprindashvili-4
```

It will download the ManageIQ image from the Docker registry. To see image list, run this

```sh
sudo docker images ls
```

---

### Stpe 2: Run Docker container

```sh
sudo docker run --privileged -d -p 8443:443 manageiq/manageiq
```

or

```sh
sudo docker run --privileged -d -p 8443:443 manageiq/manageiq:gaprindashvili-4
```

It will run the container in detached mode. `-p 8443:443` will forward your base machine's _8443_ port requests to docker container's _443_ port. To see a list of running containers, execute

```sh
sudo docker ps
```

Now ManageIQ container is up and running at IP address [https://127.0.0.1:8443](https://127.0.0.1:8443)

It has a username as _admin_ and the password is _smartvm_. Get the login and explore the world of ManageIQ.

---

### Step 3: To commit the changes Commit the container

It can be useful to commit a container’s file changes or settings into a new image. This allows you to debug a container by running an interactive shell or to export a working dataset to another server.

```sh
docker commit "container_id" manageiq
```

this saves all changes and data, next time run the `manageiq` container.
