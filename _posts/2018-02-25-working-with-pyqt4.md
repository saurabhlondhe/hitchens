# Working With PyQt4

PyQt4 is a framework for Gui Design. We were working on project Server-Suite and we were searching for a good GUI provider in python and decided to go with PyQt4.

While working on a project I learned many things and I thought about sharing them. Through this blog and Play With PyQt4, weâ€™ll be discussing PyQt things and some interesting projects done by me.

### Something about PyQt

PyQt is a set of Python v2 and v3 bindings for The Qt Companyâ€™s Qt application framework and runs on all platforms supported by Qt including Windows, OS X, Linux, iOS and Android. PyQt5 supports Qt v5. PyQt4 supports Qt v4 and will build against Qt v5. The bindings are implemented as a set of Python modules and contain over 1,000 classes.
