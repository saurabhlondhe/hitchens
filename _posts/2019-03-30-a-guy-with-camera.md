 I was planning to write a non-technical blog, many topics got in mind but the first came was _a guy with unique character_ **Akash** ([gambitier](https://gambitier.github.io/About%20Me.html)). Let me introduce him to you..., He's a Computer science Engineer. Even though we were classmates i never knew about him. He was that alone type guy but the best one yet to come ;). 


### My friend circle
I have a big friend circle and it has all kind of characters like funny, emotional, feku, cool and etc.

I have examples for each, I'll make a table with their characters and names ;-)

### How we met
I’m president of RITINLUG(RIT India Linux Users’ Group) and we have one dedicated lab(OPEN SOURCE Lab) for community work. Me, Shital and Sonalkumar used to work there together, we used to do some experiments, watch youtube and much more.

That day I and Sonalkumar were leaving late, nearly 11 pm and the guy Akash was reading a book in our CES departments porch. We approached him talked little. He used to be there at CES porch for many times. Me and Sonal (Sonalkumar) suggested him to join us in an opensource lab and he joined. From there he became part of our friend circle. Before that day he was the only stranger for us and now I’m writing a blog on him, so addictive …
