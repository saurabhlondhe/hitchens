# Hybrid-Cloud-Automation-Using-Ansible-ManageIQ
Now a days, Automation is the mother of all the inventions, that give rise to all the new technologies. Most of the latest technologies are the reason to automation. This project is one of our try to automate hybrid cloud using ManageIQ and Ansible.

A hybrid cloud is the one with the combination of both i.e. private as
well as public cloud with the specified specifications.

ManageIQ is an open source cloud management platform by Red Hat. It is written in Ruby with RoR (Ruby on Rails) as platform.

Ansible is software that automates software provisioning, configuration
management, and application deployment. Playbooks are Ansibleâ€™s
configuration, deployment, and orchestration language.

# Intorduction to ManageIQ
- ManageIQ is an Open Source Cloud management platform. The ManageIQ project founded by Red Hat In 2014 as a community  project. It is written in Ruby with RoR (Ruby on Rails) as platform.
- For getting started get a ManageIQ instanses from [here](http://manageiq.org/download/)

### Installation
- Using KVM/Qemu image

    - Download ManageIQ Image from [manageiq/downloads](http://manageiq.org/download/) choose QEmu/KVM

    - Install KVM and necessary packages

            # yum install qemu-kvm libvirt libvirt-python virt-install
    
    - Create ManageIQ VM using existing image
        - Create VM using ```virt-install``` command

                # sudo virt-install --virt-type kvm  --import --name ManageIQ  --memory 12288 --vcpus 4 --cpu host  --disk manageiq-openstack-gaprindashvili-5.qc2,format=qcow2,bus=virtio  --network default,model=virtio   --os-type=linux --os-variant=centos7.0   --graphics spice
    
    - Launch VM using ```virsh ```
            
            # virsh start ManageIQ
    - Login using ssh
            
            # ssh root@<ip_of_server>

        - user: _root_
        - password: _smartvm_

- [Using docker image](https://saurabhlondhe.github.io/project/open_source/linux/2018/08/31/Install-manageiq-in-docker.html)

# ManageIQ database configuration

ManageIQ uses PostgreSQL Database. So while dealing with ManageIQ database we'll need to follow PostgreSQL commands and procedure to take a database dump as a backup and to restore it in another instance.


    Note: ManageIQ uses "vmdb_production" database  


---
This is list of steps followed to obtain a dump from a db then retsore it

### Dump the Postgres DB:

1. stop the appliance(s):
    
        # systemctl stop evmserverd
 
    This will stop the evmserverd.service from using database in background but no need to stop them, for creating backup the doesn't affects anywhere.

2. dump the database into file:

    
        # pg_dump -Fc vmdb_production > production.dump

3. Copy the dump file to the other ManageIQ instance where the database have to restore.

    We can use `scp` for that as follows:
        
        # scp production.dump root@ip_of_other_instance:/root/

### Import the Postgres dump

1. Take `production.dump` to the local machine.

2. Stop the backend processes

        # systemctl stop evmserverd
3. Drop existing database `vmdb_production` 

        # dropdb vmdb_production

4. create new database named `vmdb_production`

        # createdb vmdb_production

5. restore the database from dump file

        # pg_restore -d vmdb_production "/path/to/production.dump
6. change directory to `/var/www/miq/vmdb/tools` 

        # vmdb  #executing "vmdb" will take you to "/var/www/miq/vmdb/"
        # cd tools
        # bundle exec fix_auth.rb --v2 --invalid bogus
7. Start evm service

        # systemctl start evmserverd
        
This will do the task of restoring database manually.
